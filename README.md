## My challenge
My challenge was to build a data storage component so that it looks as close to the design as possible.

My users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size. Focus screen sizes were 375px (mobile) and 1440px (desktop).

## New Information I Learned
I did some research on using SVG tag instead of IMG tags in my HTML. I found out that I could include a <title> tag which is similar to an alt attribute we use for images. You need to place the <title> tag right below the SVG tag. You also need to include an aria-labelledby attribute that points to the <title> tag. I could also use a <desc> tag to add a longer description for users of assistive technology. I did not use the <desc> tag since my images were general icons.
