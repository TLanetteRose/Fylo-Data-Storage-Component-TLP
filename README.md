## My challenge

Your challenge is to build out this data storage component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size







What I learned
    In the output XML for the SVG, include a title tag directly below the svg tag.

    The <title> tag for an SVG should be brief, much like an alt attribute for an image.

    In the SVG tag, include an aria-labelledby attribute that points to the <title> tag.

    If there is more than one shape, it can be a good idea to include a title tag for each shape group.

    Including a <desc> tag (description), in addition to a title tag, is very helpful for users of assistive technology.

    On his site, Dudley Storey writes that ’<desc> is a longer description of the SVG element, containing its purpose or design.’

    Example of desc tag: ‘Bar chart showing company sales by country, in millions of dollars (US).’

    If your inline SVG is decorative, however, you do not need to include any of these attributes.
